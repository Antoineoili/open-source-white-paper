# Chapter 4: Maintaining

In a [previous article](https://oss.zenika.com/white-paper/getting-started), we helped you submitting your first contribution. You now want to launch your own open source project but you don't know what to do before letting everyone view your code ? No worries, in this article we will give you all pre-requisites you need to launch your project, methods to facilitate contributions and tools to help you maintain your project in the long term.

## Pre-requisites before launching your project

If you want your project to have contributions you need to write a minimum of documentation. There are four files that are essential:

- README
- License
- Contributing guide
- Code of conduct

We will describe each one and provide you guides to help you writing them.

### README

The first is well known and you probably already have one but let's talk a bit about README.md. 

> Your project description and first paragraph of your README should be a simple summary of your project which hits all the important keywords that people search for.
> -- [<cite>Andrey Petrov</cite>](https://medium.com/code-zen/how-to-maintain-a-successful-open-source-project-aaa2a5437d3a)

Mike McQuaid theorized about [the open source contributor funnel](https://mikemcquaid.com/2018/08/14/the-open-source-contributor-funnel-why-people-dont-contribute-to-your-open-source-project/) and how to get contributors on your open source projects. You need to provide informations for every type of visitors in your README.

First of all, nobody is in your head. You should explain the **goal** of your project. It doesn't have to be an essay a single sentence is good enough like in [Conference Hall README](https://github.com/bpetetot/conference-hall).

> **Conference Hall** is an opened SaaS platform to manage call for papers and speakers submissions for your conferences and meetups. Speaker writes a talk once and can submit it to every events of the platform.

This section is the first thing a new comer read on your project, you need to catch is attention.

Another important part to document in your README is how to install and use your project. It is essential for users so they can easily test it. Gatsby does a good job explaining how to have a website [running in 5 minutes](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby#-get-up-and-running-in-5-minutes) with their cli. 

Last but not least you should provide instructions for future contributors. A simple section that link your contributing guide is most of the time enough.

A simple [template](https://www.makeareadme.com/#template-1) is available on makeareadme.com. It contains all the sections we talked about. You can find more informations about how to write a good README on this website. You can also use tools to generate your README like [readme-md-generator](https://github.com/kefranabg/readme-md-generator). It fill your README with informations extracted from git configuration or your `package.json` file if your project is made with JavaScript.
